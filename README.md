# Task Manager Assignment

This was the second part of an exercise at MakerSquare. The first part involved creating a project task manager app, using TDD,
with Ruby using the terminal client. This second part was our first introduction to databases in order to persist the 
projects and tasks. 

Using PostgreSQL, I learned about creating a database connection, data modeling, the singleton pattern, and persistence.
